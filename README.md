# OLKB-Configuration
Custom keyboard definition for my planck OLKB - Specifically, it's a Planck EZ

Forgive any glaring mistakes, I don't do a lot of work in C and I only picked up QMK a few days ago. :) 

The main functionality that this provides, beyond my basic keymappings generated from the configurator, is specific colormaps defined per layer which respect the rgb matrix's hsv value setting (so you can manually control brightness). I use this with my keymappings to highlight which keys change on my lower/raise/adjust and custom layers.
